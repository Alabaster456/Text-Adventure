Text-Adventure
==============

Update that was on Codecademy
--
I currently have the repository pulled up as well as you guys added to it, so you can either fork it or participate in the main branch (which is my file) when you please. Please keep the code in a neat order though, because we don't want it to be unorganized and hard to distinguish variables from functions, etc. If you look at the file, you'll see a good demonstration as to what I mean.

https://gitter.im/Alabaster456/Text-Adventure

We will be using Gitter (a chat application) that allows us to communicate freely through real-time, so I'll add you to that as well. It's automatically linked to your GitHub account, so no registration is required. The purpose of using Gitter is to keep track of our code and compare whenever we brainstorm some ideas, so please chat in the room actively. I don't expect you to be in it everyday (24/7), but when you're participating? Yes. :)

Whether it's a online editor or one that you downloaded, please make sure that it's Python 2.7.2. Codecademy also uses this version. It's not the latest version, but it's more preferred.
